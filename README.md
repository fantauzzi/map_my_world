# Map My World
**Experiments with Graph-SLAM and its RTAB-Map implementation in a Gazebo simulation.**
 
## Dependencies
The following needs to be installed:
- ROS Melodic or Kinetic and the corresponding Gazebo version;
- cmake 2.8.3 or later and gcc 7.5 or later.

The repository is a Catkin workspace, and includes the [rtabmap_ros](http://wiki.ros.org/rtabmap_ros) package, which in turn has several dependencies; the easiest way to install them is with:

**- for ROS Kinetic**
```shell script
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-rtabmap ros-kinetic-rtabmap-ros
sudo apt-get remove ros-kinetic-rtabmap ros-kinetic-rtabmap-ros
```
**- for ROS Melodic**
```shell script
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-rtabmap ros-melodic-rtabmap-ros
sudo apt-get remove ros-melodic-rtabmap ros-melodic-rtabmap-ros
```

Tested under Ubuntu 18.04 (ROS Melodic) and Ubuntu 16.04 (ROS Kinetic).
 
 ## Installation
Clone the GitHub repository:
```shell script
git clone https://github.com/fantauzzi/map_my_world.git
```


**Outside your Catkin workspace**, install RTAB-MAP standalone lilbraries. Add `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path to catkin ws>/devel` to the `cmake` command below if you want to install in the Catkin's devel folder (without `sudo`). Replace `<path to catkin ws>` with the path to the cloned repository (which is a catkin workspace).

```shell script
git clone https://github.com/introlab/rtabmap.git rtabmap
cd rtabmap/build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

Now you are all set to build the project (which includes the `rtabmap_ros` package). Back in the root of the cloned repository:

```shell script
catkin_make
```

It will build the project.

## Running it

In the root of the cloned repository run:
```shell script
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch my_robot world.launch 
```
Gazebo and RViz will start, showing the environment and placing a blue robot in it.

To drive the robot around, run, again in the same directory:
```shell script
source devel/setup.bash
rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py
```

The keyboard teleop node will start. The robot is non-holonomic (it has a differential drive). For the keyboard teleoperation to work, make sure you have its window/shell selected before typing.
  
In another shell, in the same directory, run:
```shell script
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch my_robot mapping.launch 
```

It will start RTAB-MAP, and begin building the map. The resulting database file is saved at the default location, `~/.ros/rtabmap.db`, overwriting any database previously saved there.

To use a map already built for localization, instead of `mapping.launch` run:

```shell script
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch my_robot localization.launch 
```

The `training_world.pgm` map has been generated from the Gazebo world using [pgm_map_creator](https://github.com/udacity/pgm_map_creator). The package itself is not included in this repository as it is not available for (and doesn't build under) Melodic.
